  "title": "Setup Quality & Maintainability Standards for React SPA",
  "description": "Configure linting, formatting, and testing infrastructure for the React SPA project to ensure code quality and maintainability. Includes ESLint configuration for React/JavaScript, Prettier for code formatting, Jest and React Testing Library for unit testing, and comprehensive documentation.",
  "steps": [
    "Create SPA project directory structure at /workspace/spa with standard React folder organization (src/, public/, src/components/, src/services/, src/utils/, src/__tests__/)",
    "Initialize package.json for the SPA with React 18.x dependencies, including react, react-dom, and development dependencies",
    "Configure ESLint for React JavaScript projects: install eslint, eslint-plugin-react, eslint-plugin-react-hooks, and eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y",
    "Create .eslintrc.json in the SPA root with React-specific rules, ES6+ syntax support, and best practices enforcement (no TypeScript rules)",
    "Configure Prettier for consistent code formatting: install prettier, eslint-config-prettier, and eslint-plugin-prettier to prevent ESLint/Prettier conflicts",
    "Create .prettierrc.json with standard formatting rules (semi: true, singleQuote: true, trailingComma: 'es5', tabWidth: 2, printWidth: 100)",
    "Add .prettierignore file to exclude node_modules, build, and dist directories from formatting",
    "Install and configure Jest testing framework with @testing-library/react, @testing-library/jest-dom, and @testing-library/user-event",
    "Create jest.config.js with appropriate settings for React testing (jsdom environment, coverage thresholds, module name mapping)",
    "Set up testing utilities in src/utils/testUtils.js with custom render functions and common test helpers",
    "Create example unit tests for at least 3 common React component patterns: functional component with hooks, component with props, and component with user interactions",
    "Add npm scripts to package.json: 'lint' (eslint src/), 'lint:fix' (eslint --fix), 'format' (prettier --write), 'format:check' (prettier --check), 'test' (jest), 'test:watch' (jest --watch), 'test:coverage' (jest --coverage)",
    "Create pre-commit hook configuration (using husky) to run linting and formatting checks before commits",
    "Create comprehensive README.md for the SPA with sections: project overview, prerequisites, installation, available scripts, project structure, coding standards, testing guidelines, and troubleshooting",
    "Add development workflow documentation including how to run the SPA locally, how to run tests, and how to integrate with the Firebase functions backend",
    "Configure VSCode settings recommendations in .vscode/settings.json for automatic formatting on save and ESLint integration",
    "Create .env.example file with required environment variables (REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL, REACT_APP_PASSCODES_ADMIN) and documentation for each",
    "Add .gitignore file specific to React SPA projects (node_modules, build, .env, coverage, .DS_Store, etc.)",
    "Verify all linting rules pass with sample React components and fix any configuration issues",
    "Verify all tests pass and coverage reporting works correctly",
    "Document the relationship between the SPA and the Spurgeon Vector API backend in the README with example API calls and authentication setup"
