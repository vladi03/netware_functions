# Review Notes: Torah_Mosaic_Report_Vlad_Martinez.docx

## Scope
Default review only:
- Grammar issues
- Malapropisms
- Bad or awkward phrasing
- Parallelism issues

## Findings

1. `NEW` `Awkward phrasing`
- Original: "     This is the state to which humanity desires to be returned and restored to after the fall."
- Issue: Mixed passive/active intent creates awkward meaning (`desires to be returned`).
- Suggested fix: "This is the state to which humanity desires to return and be restored after the fall."
